# Python-Projects
This repository is the home page of the Python-Projects I have created to display a combination of python expertise and data analysis work using Python's Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Plotly modules to create, clean, analyze, manipulate, and visualize personalized data as well as data found through Kaggle and their data sets.
