# Python-Projects
This repository is the home page of the Python-Projects I have created to display a combination of python expertise and data analysis work using Python's Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Plotly libraries to create, clean, analyze, manipulate, and visualize personalized data as well as data found through Kaggle and their data sets.

Project Name  | Description   |  Topic
------------- | ------------- | ------------------
[Analzying Social Media User Data](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Social%20Media%20Database) | Using a custom made JSON file with 50 different users, the data will be put through Python's Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Plotly libraries to form a detailed analysis dissecting and visualizing different media's user data. | JSON, Python, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, database analyzation, debugging code
[Cheat Sheet Functions](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Cheat%20Sheet%20Functions) | Custom made functions for the purpose of making coding just a little bit easier! | function creation, data analytics.
[Neural Network for Pattern Recognition and Analyzation](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Neural%20Network) | Creation of a neural network for the purpose of reading CSV/JSON files and locating any possible numerical patterns, diplay those patterns, and show a 1y, 5y, and 10y forecast of said pattern | Pandas, Pytorch, NumPy, Machine Learning.
