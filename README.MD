# Python-Projects
This repository is the home page of the Python-Projects I have created to display a combination of python expertise and data analysis work using Python's Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Pytorch and Matplotlib libraries to create, clean, analyze, manipulate, and visualize personalized data.

Project Name  | Description   |  Topic
------------- | ------------- | ------------------
[Analzying Social Media User Data](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Social%20Media%20Database) | Using a custom made JSON file with 50 different users, the data will be put through Python's Pandas, SciPy, and Maplotlib libraries to form a detailed analysis dissecting and visualizing different media's user data. | JSON creation, Python, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, database analyzation, debugging code
[Cheat Sheet Functions](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Cheat%20Sheet%20Functions) | Custom made functions for the purpose of making coding just a little bit easier! | Pandas, Numpy, function creation, data analytics, encoding |
[SQLAlchemy Query Process](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/SQLAlchemy) | Python code displaying the modeling, ingestion, and query process of a dynamically created schema able to handle file imports utilizing SQLAlchemy.ORM and Pandas. Features include the database construction, row / col manipulation, table joining, and aggregate functions. | Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy.ORM
[Playwright Browser Automation Template](https://github.com/Josh9182/Python-Projects/tree/main/Web%20Automation) | Python code displaying the creation of a dynamic Playwright function, navigating through a template website and performing a multitude of sample tasks based off a sample CSV file. Tasks include input clicking / filling, lambda functions, button pressing, and HTML / CSS element navigating | Python, Pandas, Playwright
